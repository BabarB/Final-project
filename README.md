# Declutter!
  Declutter! is the first rough  version of a project I would like to extend in the future. The target audience is people with shopping addiction, to which the website offers meditation as a temporary solution. I have encountered people suffering from shopping addiction in my family and previous career. As regular meditator I strongly believe that this could be the answer for them.
  The website was coded using the mobile fist principle: following coding for mobile, I then went on to code for tablet and then laptop and larger screens. In line with this, I will be attaching screenshots of mobile screens.

## Features



### Navigation
The navigation menu is inside the header. The site features a standard responsive navigation menu on the top right. On the top left, in line with user expectations, there is a site logo that navigates the visitor back to the home page.
A link redundancy (home as well as logo both redirect users to home) can be noted here, however this is often the case with websites, indluding the CI Walkthrough project. Because the average website visitor, like me, often encounters such redundancy, they will come to expect it. Considering the Stretegy Pane, such redundancy will impact the structure of the website to contribute to a good user experience.

Due to the very specific audience of the site, the main page is not the landing page but the "meditate" page. Navigation to this page is further facilitated by call to action buttons.



### The Main Content

### Index.html
On the homepage, visitors will find information about meditation's ability to tackle shopping addiction. The first text is fairly short and uses a personal, question format to raise the immediate interest of those affected. If this resonates with them, they can click the call to action button straight away to land on the "Meditate" page. Undecisive visitors can read a text with further information, after which the same call to action button repeats for their convenience (i.e. to avoid having to scroll up again). This is another example of redundancy facilitating user experience, with the strategic pane impacting on the structural pane.

The hero image is placed to the right of the short into text to reinforce their point. It is not in the background, rather, visual summary of what the visitor may wish to achieve.  The logo and favicon serve a similar purpose: The one-word slogan with an exclamation mark promotes a result oriented approach as opposed to procrastination. This is in line with meditation's approach to stay in the present momet. "Declutter!" suggests: don't think about it, do it, and do it now.

## The Footer

Links to social media sites are located in the footer. For my own privary, I used dummy links that open in a new window. The youtube channel, as I do not have one yet, points to my husband's channel as a temporary fix, in case the assessors of the site fancy listening to some good music.

*For generating the favicon used the following generator: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/

* For the pictures I used https://www.istockphoto.com/



* I used ChatGPT to create the initial draft texts, these were then rewritten by myself to sound more relevant and personal to the site's visitor.

* The meditation audios have been written by ChatGPT and re-written bx myself, the reader was Robert Tubb.

##  Deployment and Testing
### 
Testing

#### Functional testing
Next to brosser tools, testing was carried out on actual devices by other people. So the tablet view was tested on an ipad, and the mobile view on a phone. Reasons:
to give visitors of the site a real user experience, which leads to them sharing their first impressions. The test was carr

#### Lighthouse testing


#### Form testing




## Design
I created a basic wireframe: Daisy shall I redo it retrospectively?
